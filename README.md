# GUtils.NET
A general utilities library I made from things I use frequently in all of my projects. Not all of it is made by me.

# Requirements
Depends on the package(s) being used.

# Features
- Glob file searching;
- Fast file copying (with configurable buffer size);
- Multithread form operations extension (just use .InvokeEx&lt;T&gt; on any of your form controls); ([StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/711419/2671392))
- Relative path processing (get a path relative to another); ([StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6194678/2671392))
- Progress bar with progress text inside it;([modified from StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29175656))
- ToolTip Mangager (automatically show a tooltip with the text, icon and caption you configure when the user hovers or focuses a control);
- Folder Select Dialog on vista-style ([Bill at lyquidity.com](http://www.lyquidity.com/devblog/?p=136))
- Explorer.exe utility class (open explorer on folder, open on folder with a file selected, open file with associated program).
